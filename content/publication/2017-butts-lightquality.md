abstract = "Corn-weed competition has often been characterized as the competition for limited resources such as light quantity, water, and nutrients. However, growing evidence suggests that light quality, specifically the red:far red ratio (R:FR), is a crucial component to corn-weed interactions. Additionally, a reduction in the R:FR has shown to down-regulate plant genes similarly to a nitrogen (N) deficient environment. A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the effect of N stress and R:FR from common waterhemp, velvetleaf, and volunteer corn on corn growth and development. The R:FR for all three weed species tended to be similar but lower than a weed-free treatment. However, observations from the spectral response curves demonstrated significant changes in the patterns of light reflected from each weed species. In the N-sufficient environment, early-season (V5 corn growth stage) R:FR from all three weed species reduced corn height, leaf chlorophyll content, and shoot biomass while increasing fibrous root biomass. However, in the N-deficient environment, no effects were observed on corn growth from changes in light quality, indicating N stress was a greater limiting factor. These results highlight the importance of the critical weed-free period and the need for proper early-season weed management."
