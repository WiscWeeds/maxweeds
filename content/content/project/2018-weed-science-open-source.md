  The advance of statistical software can make more comfortable for weed science practitioners (professor, technician, and student) to handle research data using programming languages. The idea of the [Open Source Weed Science] (//github.com/maxwelco/open-source-weed-science) project is to have a repository in [GitHub] (//github.com/) or create a website (working on that idea) with the typical data analysis of weed research. 
  
  I first heard about [Open Source Weed Science](//github.com/maxwelco/open-source-weed-science) project as a graduate student in Nebraska. My colleagues [Rodrigo Werle](https://twitter.com/WiscWeeds) and [Strahinja Stepanovic](https://twitter.com/agwithstrahinja) have the idea before. But somehow it did work well. I will start sharing R codes that I have been using in weed research in my blog and storing the files on GitHub. I plan to open to everyone to collaborate with their codes.
