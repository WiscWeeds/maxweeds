  Back in 2007, I downloaded R for the first time during a statistical class in my BSc degree. However, I did not see much necessity of R and the interface was not friendly. At that time, I had no idea about the power of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R-studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) software. When I joined the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2014, I took statistics class that used SAS as standard software. With SAS, I liked using for ANOVA, but I found challenging to conduct quantitative data analysis and plotting regression curves. Also, SAS is not an open source; as a result, there was no much help on the web (blogs, etc). 
  
  My second contact in R, I fitted some herbicide dose-response curves using package [drc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/drc/drc.pdf) in 2014. I started using R and R-studio on a daily basis for fitting herbicide dose-response curves from my Ph.D. project. Also, I use R quite a bit for research data analysis of the weed science program of my former adviser, [Stevan Knezevic](https://agronomy.unl.edu/knezevic). I was the only graduate student in his weed science program in Nebraska. Therefore, I was responsible for the majority of the data analysis, which I benefit for improving my skills in R. I was using SAS for qualitative data (ANOVA) and R for quantitative (regression). Additionally, R and R-studio have marvelous tools for optimizing time (tidying data) and data visualization. All the figures of my conferences talks, posters, and published papers were done using R-studio.
  
  When I started my position at the [UW-Madison](https://wisc.edu) early this year, my boss [Rodrigo Werle](https://www.twitter.com/WiscWeeds) told me about his idea to create a website. He plans to create an easy way to communicate results from our weed science program to the agricultural audience. In fact, I told him to find someone else to build his lab website. However, I was aware of [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which allows anyone to create a site using R-studio and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a website generator. I started to work on blogdown as a side project. My idea was to create my blog as a prototype. When I realized, my blog turns our well; I did it: raised_hands:. I think that having my blog will help to propagate my [Open Source Weed Science](https://github.com/maxwelco/open-source-weed-science) project, which will be a repository (or website) for sharing R codes. Also, Academic blog is an excellent tool for marketing our careers as scientists. 
  
  I am not an expert, but I enjoy R programming. I believe that everyone can build their website using blogdown. I am still convincing Rodrigo to create his lab website with blogdown and Hugo. 
  
  If you want to create your website with blogdown, there are many tutorials on GitHub or other blogs. I can recommend two sources, the [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and a [post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) by Alison Presmanes Hill. Good luck!
