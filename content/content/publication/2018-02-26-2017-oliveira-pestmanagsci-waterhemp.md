# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "BACKGROUND A population of Amaranthus tuberculatus (var. rudis) was confirmed resistant to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-inhibitor herbicides (mesotrione, tembotrione, and topramezone) in a seed corn/soybean rotation in Nebraska. Further investigation confirmed a non-target-site resistance mechanism in this population. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of cytochrome P450 inhibitors in restoring the efficacy of HPPD-inhibitor herbicides on the HPPD-inhibitor resistant A. tuberculatus population from Nebraska, USA (HPPD-R). RESULTS Enhanced metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes is the mechanism of resistance in HPPD-R. Amitrole partially restored the activity of mesotrione, whereas malathion, amitrole, and piperonyl butoxide restored the activity of tembotrione and topramezone in HPPD-R. Although corn was injured through malathion followed by mesotrione application a week after treatment, the injury was transient, and the crop recovered. CONCLUSION The use of cytochrome P450 inhibitors with tembotrione may provide a new way of controlling HPPD-inhibitor resistant A. tuberculatus, but further research is needed to identify the cytochrome P450 candidate gene(s) conferring metabolism-based resistance. The results presented here aid to gain an insight into non-target-site resistance weed management strategies."
