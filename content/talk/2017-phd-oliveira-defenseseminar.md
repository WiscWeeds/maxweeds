abstract = "The rapid adaptation of waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus (var. rudis)] to modern agriculture made the species an excellent model for studying herbicide resistance evolution. Failure to control an A. tuberculatus population with postemergence (POST)-applied 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-inhibitor herbicide was reported in northeast Nebraska. We confirmed the herbicide resistance and explored empirical studies on the physiology, genetics, and ecology of an HPPD-resistant A. tuberculatus population in Nebraska."
